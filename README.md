> [!WARNING]

> [!NOTE]
> VoiceCraft is also not a standard voice chat that comes with groups or channels. It is designed to be customized

## Project Description

VoiceCraft is a cross-platform proximity voice chat solution for minecraft bedrock edition. VoiceCraft supports a wide
range of devices to increase its availability to players and can indirectly support any other devices such as consoles
through the standard binding system.

VoiceCraft is developed in C# for both the server and client application which uses the avalonia framework and uses an
addon developed in JavaScript to establish a connection to the vanilla minecraft server.
VoiceCraft also uses the opus codec for audio data compression and SpeexDSP for voice enhancements with optional support
for hardware related preprocessors on android devices.

There is also a comprehensive API system in place that addon developer's can use to customize VoiceCraft's behavior,
audio effects, audio simulations, authentication, and more!
